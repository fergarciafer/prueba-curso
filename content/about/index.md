Welcome to my personal site. My name is Fernando García. Most of my professional career has been related to data: data migrations, database administration, business intelligence. And now Big Data and data science.

I work as a Business Intelligence Analyst at the Universidad Argentina de la Empresa ([**UADE**](https://www.uade.edu.ar/)). For many years I have specialized in Oracle database administration, mainly in large Telecommunications companies in my country. I was founder and part of the Oracle Users Group of Argentina ([**AROUG**](http://aroug.org/quienes-somos/)). Thanks to my technical skills and enthusiasm for the user's community I was awarded with as an [**Oracle ACE**](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:1160). I often contribute to [**ToadWorld**](https://blog.toadworld.com/author/fernando-garcia) with technical articles. A short time ago I joined [**The Carpentries Latinoamérica**](https://Carpentries.org), a community whose mission is to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers.

Most of the technologies I use in my daily activities, didn't exist during my life as a student at university. That's why I really believe in continuous learning. I'm a lifetime learner.

If you are interested in working with me on a project, you can contact me.
