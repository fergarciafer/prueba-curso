      <description>A few weeks ago I joined The Carpentries Latin America. The Carpentries is a community whose mission is to teach basic programming and data science skills to researchers around the world. The Carpentries Latin America is a group that works to extend the initiative of The Carpentries throughout the countries of this region.
 I have joined the team of Spanish translators; a team dedicated to translating and maintaining The Carpentries classes in Spanish.</description>

Code/Rag has always been more than just another online tech blog. We strive to be part of the tech community—serving an essential, fundamental look at what’s going on in the valley. It’s why our tagline is “Know Your Code.” We think a tech news publication should know the basics. Be the source. Get down to brass tacks. We can do that because we’re part of the very ecosystem we’re reporting on.</description>
